Title: The Way to Vim

"It is a tool, the use of which [must be learned](http://www.vim.org/about.php)".

Vim has been my system and software editor for 18 years (1997). I've been a
mediocre vim user this whole time. I've left vim unconfigured and haven't had a
vimrc file.

Two things have changed in my life. I'm now the parent of three children and
I'm working on transitioning to being a software maker. I'm forced to be more
productive and be productive in programmer ways.

Changing how I use vim is also influenced by changes in software systems. The
continued advancement of automation, distribution and virtualization means
logging into server and opening individual text files in unconfigured vim will
only get my so far these days. I suspect the next generation of advanced
technical support and quality assurance analysts will not be able to get the
same value as I have out of unconfigured vim.

Even if you don't want or need to know vim, I would still highly recommend
learning the basics and philosophy of it. Many unix commands use the same keys
. More importantly, you'll get the flavor of the unix philosophy: combining
small, sharp tools.

I've started now to really learn how to use vim starting with [first
principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle).  Only as I'm
starting this journey deeper into vim do I begin to understand why I've gotten
so much value out of just using vim. My activities have aligned with "normal"
mode.  I've spent half my life viewing, paging and searching through software
output.

One of the best ways for me to learn is to figure out how I would help someone
else learn, so here it is.

## Small Doses

I was embarrassed to discover just how good the documentation is and how solved all the problems I thought I had with learning vim are. As I led with, vim is a tool which must be learned. It is best learned using first principles and learning in small doses. I'll revisit this. Let's get on with the show.

## Get Seated

Mike "mscccc" Coutermarsh provides the best introduction to vim with the mistited, [Learning Vim in a Week](https://mikecoutermarsh.com/boston-vim-learning-vim-in-a-week/). That article includes the slides. He has an older article, also mistitled, "[Learning Vim in a Week](https://mikecoutermarsh.com/learning-vim-in-a-week/)" in a tip form.

## Get Excited

Here are a couple of my favorite videos that after watching mscccc's presentation got me jazzed to go deeper.

Ben Orenstein's "[Write code faster: expert-level vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkdrYWhh-8s)" [Notes from an older version](https://github.com/r00k/talk_notes) of the talk are on github.

Damian Conway's "[More Instantly Better Vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm36-na4-4)"

## Calm Down

I've spent many years delaying learning vim. It's partly, because I'm so focused in my daily work in promoting making decisions not options. I waited in frustration for gvim, cream, and macvim to impress me out of the box. I missed the point and you will too if you copy someone else's vim configuration or immediately leap to download the most popularly vim plugins. **Your configuration should evolve to match your own evolving workflow.**

This takes time. Give yourself the time to learn in small doses.

## Thank Yous

I've only gotten [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) in the last six
months and there is no going back. The community has refired my engine for
personal and software development.


Thank you to [Bram Moolenaar](http://www.moolenaar.net/), the creator of vim,
still leading development 23 years later. `:help uganda`. The welcome text has
changed a little bit, calming people just looking for open source,  but the
message is still the same. It was an incredible concept to me then. It has
continued to inspire me. Its continued to be a reminder to me that I can get
too caught up in just the freedom of the software. Unfortunately, the messsage
is still radical.



I think Bram's premise has led to vim's community being so welcoming and
helpful. Thank you to [z1mm32m4n](https://twitter.com/z1mm32m4n),
[https://github.com/fatih](https://github.com/fatih),
[lcd047](https://github.com/lcd047) and many others for their patience and
generousity in helping me.

Thank you to thoughtbot, who's immensely helped developers get excited and learn vim, and who [created](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/tags/vim) and [currated](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8tzorAO7s0jy7DQ3Q0FwF3BnXGQnDirs) a lot of vim educational material.

Thank you to [Drew Neil](https://twitter.com/nelstrom), who's [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) dishes out free, perfect bite size vim topics.

We wouldn't have vim, if we didn't have vi. Thank you to Chuck Haley and Bill
Joy for ex and vi. I'll stop as my ancestrial and sibling thank yous would grow
long.

[termie](https://twitter.com/termie) and
[novas0x2a](https://twitter.com/novas0x2a) stand out in my mind as inspiring
vim users that I've had the pleasure to work with. Two people that inspire me
with their personalilities, daily successes and ability to make those around
them better.
