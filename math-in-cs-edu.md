Fifteen years since graduating this still brings back painful memories. I graduated in 2000 from the University of Victoria, Canada with a degree in Computer Science from the Faculty of Engineering, participating in the brand new, one of the first, Software Engineering programs. It looks like more recent graduates can get "Software Engineering Option appears on transcript", https://www.csc.uvic.ca/Program_Information/Undergraduate_Studies/SoftwareEngineeringOption.htm

As people argue in other comments here, software programming is not computer science.  But neither is much of the course work in a computer science degree. Although, I did well be trying to learn the science (and some math and philosophy), many people coming up with me did well be training themselves to be good or great programmers.

Where these people stumbled and sometimes well was getting through the two 2nd year classes: Matrix Algebra, and Differential Equations.

It doesn't look like that has changed any:

Having interviewed many new grad job candidates over the years, nothing has changed in most universities and colleges at least in north america.

My conclusion then, stands today, the algebraic math focus is used to weed out people. Autodidact learning, particularly in the young art of programming, was magnitudes harder back then and many people dropped out of the path to programming -- I suspect with sadness that the few a high percentage of women stopped at this point

The OP article 

Am I mistaken? Have the computer science degree programs at other colleges been reformed? Are there new software programmer vocational schools (in Europe) like for other fields?
